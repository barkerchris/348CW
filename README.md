## Introduction
This project was made for my Web Apps module coursework. It is aimed at Lecturers and Students. This site allows for the creation of posts and comments useful for Lecturers and Students trying to keep up to date with their work. Lecture notes can be uploaded, and the comment section encourages interaction and discussion. Built using Laravel.
